# BattleShip
Real time Battleship (with real time chat) implemented with sockets on a Java Backend and a React Js frontend.
To use, you need postgres installed. Run postgres in the background, and run Java from Springboot run and cd in the React-Front from the terminal and do npm start.
Go to http://localhost:3000/ to start as first player and http://localhost:3000/ again for second player. You can also look at the console for real time socket events.
